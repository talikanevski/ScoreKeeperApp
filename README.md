# ScoreKeeperApp
ScoreKeeperApp designed for Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program. 2nd project.
The app gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different players playing a bambinthon game.
Button “WIN” increase the player’s score.
Button “FAULT” increase the competitor’s score.
Button “RED CARD 1” decrease the player’s score.
And button “RED CARD 2” makes the competitor’s score 21, which means that the end of the game.
When one of the players rich 21, toast pop up and say “We have a winner”.
I’ve added a reset button “Play again”.
